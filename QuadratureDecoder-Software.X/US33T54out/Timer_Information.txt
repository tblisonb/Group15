Watch function / Response time metrics 

The watch function is a variable value monitor only, not a timer.
	- Can be used to see how a variable changes at each instruction/line of code
	
The stopwatch funciton in the debugging window is what we are looking for
	- Not available in the ATmega4908 Curiosity Nano on board debugger
	
Alternative is the TCA peripherals (timer counters)
	- Set up one of peripherals at an empty pin(s) and enable the use in the debugger via register DBGCTRL
	- Works as a Pulse Width Modulation peripheral
	- Currently working on a way to utilize this as a program timer which counts with every pulse 

Another method to find response time is via the time.h library, found in the C standard library
	- Can measure by time in seconds or by system clocks
	- For system clocks, we can get seconds by dividing the found clocks by the CLOCKS_PER_SEC macro included in the library
	- Functions to use are time(&variableName) and variableName = clock();

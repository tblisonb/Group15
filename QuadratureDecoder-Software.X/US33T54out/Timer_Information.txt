Watch function / Response time metrics 

The watch function is a variable value monitor only, not a timer.
	- Can be used to see how a variable changes at each instruction/line of code
	
The stopwatch funciton in the debugging window is what we are looking for
	- Not available in the ATmega4908 Curiosity Nano on board debugger
	
Alternative is the TCA peripherals (timer counters)
	- Set up one of peripherals at an empty pin(s) and enable the use in the debugger via register DBGCTRL
	- Still working on how to update the timer to restart at provided breakpoints

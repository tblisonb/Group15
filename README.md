# Group 15 - Microchip
### Group Members
* Zane Guess
* Jessica Gilbert
* Jason Guest
* Manolito Ramirez
* Tanner Lisonbee

### Project Objectives
* To develop implementations of a quadrature decoder in software, using hardware interrupts, and using the CCL peripheral found on the ATmega4809
* To analyze the differences between the implementations to demonstrate the usefulness of the CCL peripheral and how it can be used to improve the responsiveness and provided functionality of a given project
* To report on the current state of development tools, including MPLAB X and MCC in order to provide feedback and report issues found while developing for the ATmega4809
* To generate application-oriented projects which demonstrate the usefulness of the CCL peripheral

### Setting up the Software
Download the ProjectNameHere.x, then install mplabX from microchipâ€™s official website or [here](https://www.microchip.com/development-tools/pic-and-dspic-downloads-archive). After downloading both open mplabx and select open project, and go to where you downloaded ProjectNameHere.x and open the project by selecting that folder. Plug in the board using a micro usb to your computer and push run.

### Setting up the Hardware
* Download and print the 3-d model, [here](), after printing the parts assemble the parts.
* Purchase an extruder, and attach to the product.
* Mount the atmega 4809 and BLE to the underside of the extruder.
* Mount the quadrature encoder on the mark that says QE.
* Wire the QE and BLE to the Atmega 4809 as shown in the diagram bellow.

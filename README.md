# Group 15 - Microchip
### Group Members
* Zane Guess
* Jessica Gilbert
* Jason Guest
* Manolito Ramirez
* Tanner Lisonbee

### Project Objectives
* To develop implementations of a quadrature decoder in software, using hardware interrupts, and using the CCL peripheral found on the ATmega4809
* To analyze the differences between the implementations to demonstrate the usefulness of the CCL peripheral and how it can be used to improve the responsiveness and provided functionality of a given project
* To report on the current state of development tools, including MPLAB X and MCC in order to provide feedback and report issues found while developing for the ATmega4809
* To generate application-oriented projects which demonstrate the usefulness of the CCL peripheral

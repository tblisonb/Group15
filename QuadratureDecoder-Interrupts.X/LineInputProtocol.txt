Protocol for interpreting binary values indicating line unput state from rotary encoder

From the software implementation (It's most clear where the values are coming from here):
There are two values being watched, and these values can also be sent over USART.
In this specific implementation, simple messages are being sent.
newA = clkPin
newB = dtPin

if received values are newA = 1 and newB = 0, then a clockwise turn is being made.
if received values are newA = 1 and newB = 1, then a counter-clockwise turn is being made.
In addition:
if received values are newA = 0 and newB = 1, a clockwise turn is being made.
if received values are newA = 0 and newB = 0, a counter-clockwise turn is being made.
Essentially, if the received values (two binary digits over USART) are different
in value, there is clockwise movement, and counter-clockwise for equal values. 

For the above to be the protocol in understanding the values, a system in which only 
the values of 1 or 0 for newA and newB are being sent and received over USART needs
to be in place. Adding the system state or other metrics will add more digits to the 
stream, in which case the user should also include a text signal or message 
illlustrating what the value corresponds to is recommended.
